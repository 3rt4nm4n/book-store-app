# book-store-app

This app simulates a bookstore owner/worker. Or it can be used to list books that the user has read. 
The app was actually made by me months ago to implement ObservableCollection <T> Class and practice Windows Forms.

Guide:

After logging into the app (Username=admin Password=password), on the next window you can choose a category and add a related book. 
If you check the confirm checkbox, you will be allowed to go to the next window. 
In the last window the user can either delete the selected book or click on "Add Another Book" to go back to the previous page.
